    "# Tutorial: Build Your First Question Answering System\n",
    "\n",
    "> We've modified this first tutorial to make it simpler to start with. If you're looking for a Question Answering tutorial that uses a DocumentStore such as Elasticsearch, go to our new [Build a Scalable Question Answering System](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/03_scalable_qa_system) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level**: Beginner\n",
    "- **Time to complete**: 15 minutes\n",
    "- **Nodes Used**: `InMemoryDocumentStore`, `BM25Retriever`, `FARMReader`\n",
    "- **Goal**: After completing this tutorial, you will have learned about the Reader and Retriever, and built a question answering pipeline that can answer questions about the Game of Thrones series.\n"

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn how to build a question answering system using Haystack's DocumentStore, Retriever, and Reader. Your system will use Game of Thrones files and will be able to answer questions like \"Who is the father of Arya Stark?\". But you can use it to run on any other set of documents, such as your company's internal wikis or a collection of financial reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started quicker, we simplified certain steps in this tutorial. For example, Document preparation and pipeline initialization are handled by ready-made classes that replace lines of initialization code. But don't worry! This doesn't affect how well the question answering system performs."

It changes depending on the locations visited in the particular episode it introduces.  The title sequence was created by Elastic for HBO, and is accompanied by a theme tune composed by Ramin Djawadi.\\n\\nThe sequence depicts a three-dimensional map of the series' fictional world, projected onto a concave earth, and lit by a small sun contained within an armilla (or spherical astrolabe) that metaphorically depicts major events in the history of the fictional world at the sphere's center. As the camera swoops across the map and focuses on the locations in which the episode's events take place, complicated clockwork mechanisms cause buildings and other structures to emerge from the map and unfold. Meanwhile, the names of the principal cast (with the symbols of the characters' families next to the names) and creative staff are displayed. The sequence concludes after about one-and-a-half minutes with the title card and brief opening credits indicating the episode's writers and directors.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '1eda7e619e4122ce8ece54663206274e'}>,\n",

The title sequence has been ranked one of the best TV title sequences of all time.\\n\\n==Description==\\nThe title sequence consists of a three-dimensional map of the world, with the continents of Westeros and Essos located on the inner surface of a sphere, which is rendered in the style of a fantasy role-playing map used as a game board by participants for their battle plans. The maps used are those of Westeros and Essos that precede the novels in the book series. At the center of the sphere is a heliocentric armillary sphere. The title sequence serves as a guide to the physical landscape of the world of ''Game of Thrones'', and details of the title sequence change each week depending on the locations visited, and new locations may be added in each season.\\n\\nThe sequence of every episode opens with a close-up of the sun and the sphere surrounding it. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '8d8f565436ac160f67788e422a4938cf'}>,\n",

The camera then pans to different parts of the map, on which different locations in the fictional world are shown.  Many of the cities and buildings on these locations appear out of the ground using clockwork mechanisms. Other elements, such as the weirwood tree at Winterfell and the Horse Gate at Vaes Dothrak, are also added at the various locations. The locations shown vary depending on the locations visited in that particular episode, and three or four variations of the title sequence are shown in each season.  However, due to the limitation on time for the title sequence, no more than six locations may be shown in any episode. Also, because of their importance in the show, every episode features King's Landing, Winterfell, The Wall, and wherever Daenerys may be regardless of whether or not any of these locations is featured in that episode.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 2}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd1215719c27addb8b7c1f3f1971c3b3f'}>,\n",

Other events in the show are also reflected in the title sequence. For example, after Winterfell is burned, smoke is depicted billowing out from it. The ''Game of Thrones'' logo appears over the armilla at the end.\\n\\nHBO released an interactive 360-degree video of the title sequence in season 6.\\n\\nWhile the locations featured change from episode to episode, the general design and route of the sequence remain roughly similar.

The appearance of the armilla and the events depicted on it also change to reflect event of the season 7 finale, such as the fall of the Wall.\\n\\n==Conception and production==\\nThe title sequence was created by three teams: its design, which forms the bulk of the project, was done by Elastic, the computer graphics by a52, and the title sequence editing by Rock Paper Scissors. Elastic had previously created the title sequences for ''Rome'', ''Big Love'', and ''Carnivale'' for HBO, and they were approached by Carolyn Strauss of HBO, with whom they had worked on these shows, to create the title sequence for ''Game of Thrones''.  \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 4}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a092d9e32fe0710415e53b67baaa1f30'}>,\n",

An early suggestion was to use animated maps as a transition between scenes to orient viewers, but that idea was dropped as it would interrupt the narrative flow. The idea of the map was therefore moved into the title sequence.  For the original pilot, the showrunners Benioff and Weiss initially wrote the title sequence as a crow's flight from King's Landing to Winterfell;  however, the production team at Elastic thought the idea was too flat and devised the idea of using 3-D models within a sphere that represents the world of the show.

Sandor serves as King Joffrey Baratheon's personal bodyguard. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), and ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005).

He said that he started humming what would become the theme tune in the car after seeing the visuals for the title sequence, and conceived of the idea for the theme on the drive back to his studio. The finished theme music was presented to the producer three days later.\\n\\nDjawadi said he intended to capture the overall impression of the show with the theme tune. Cello is featured strongly as Benioff and Weiss wanted to avoid the flutes or solo vocals found in many other productions in the fantasy genre so as to give the show a distinctive sound, and Djawadi chose cello as the main instrument for the music as he thought it has a \"darker sound\" that suited the show.\\n\\nDjawadi started with a riff and he built the title theme around the riff.

So even though the majority of the piece is in minor, there\\'s that little hint of major in there where it kinda switches and then it changes back again.\"The main melody is then introduced with the cello, joined later by a solo violin that may suggest an interplay between different characters. The melody is then repeated with the entire orchestra. The next section introduces a change in melody, described by Djawadi as giving \"a sense of adventure\", and continues with a repeat that involves a choir of twenty female voices - recorded in Prague, like the instrumental parts. The title theme ends with a combination of dulcimer and kantele, producing a \"shimmery quality\" in its sound that Djawadi thought would give a sense of mystery and anticipation for the episode.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 2}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a675202400e811acba73a24ce9b0ec9f'}>,\n",

In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14 deaths.\\n\\n===Themes===\\n\\nThe series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre.

Just like people\\'s capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story. Benioff said, \"George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy. He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe.\"In early seasons, under the influence of the \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.

Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval Europe, from lands and cultures, to the palace intrigue, feudal system, castles, and knightly tournaments. A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) between the houses of Lancaster and York, reflected in Martin\\'s houses of Lannister and Stark. The scheming Cersei Lannister evokes Isabella, the \"she-wolf of France\" (1295–1358).

The success of the genre had been attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 36}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '6995dab15ad7abbba16630c6ffeababf'}>,\n",

A first season scene in which Petyr Baelish explains his motives (or background) while prostitutes have sex in the background gave rise to the word \"sexposition\" for providing exposition with sex and nudity. \"Dothraki\", the series\\' nomadic horsemen, was ranked fourth in a September 2012 Global Language Monitor list of words from television most used on the Internet. In 2012, the media used \"Game of Thrones\" as a figure of speech or comparison for situations of intense conflict and deceit, such as US healthcare politics, the Syrian Civil War and the ousting of Bo Xilai from the Chinese government.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 37}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '42eca3726f03b91888a401486cb90e75'}>,\n",

The food allowed Stannis\\'s men to hold on until Eddard Stark arrived to break the siege.

Sansa's interests are music, poetry, and singing. She strives to become like the heroines of romantic tales by attempting to find a prince, knight, or gentleman to fall in love with. For a companion animal, she owned a direwolf named Lady. However, Lady was killed in place of Arya's direwolf, Nymeria, after Nymeria attacked the Crown Prince, Joffrey Baratheon, and later fled.\\n\\nSansa has been described as tall, slim, womanly, and beautiful, destined to be a lady or a queen.

And you need that to be revealed at some point, don\\'t you?\"The uncertainty arises from anecdotal evidence in the texts interpreted by readers to connect the mysterious maternity of Ned\\'s son with the vague backstory of his sister Lyanna.\\n\\nAs recounted by Ned in \\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\', at a tourney years before the events of the novel, Rhaegar had shown public favor to Lyanna in the presence of his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell. When Rhaegar and Lyanna disappeared a year later, her father Rickard and eldest brother Brandon confronted Rhaegar\\'s father, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, demanding that his son return the abducted Lyanna.
